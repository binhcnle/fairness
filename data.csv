Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.

If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don't know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.

Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:  Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it’s COVID-19? Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.

If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet's treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time.   What is a novel coronavirus? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans  and cause mild illness, like the common cold.  Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it's always a good idea to practice healthy habits  around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.   What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)? Imported animals will need to meet CDC  and USDA'sexternal icon  requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.

This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.   Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak? Please refer to CDC's requirements for bringing a dog to the United States . The current requirements for rabies vaccination  apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.  Are imported animals or animal products safe? CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates  animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulates  animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulates  importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources.

   What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19.

Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19.  Do not let pets in the facility interact with sick people. Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility. Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible. Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. People sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals. Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas. Cats should be kept...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Can I take my dog to daycare or a groomer? Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather.

Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a mask  and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible.

Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectant  to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol,...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Can I take my dog to a dog park? Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather.

Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park.  Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are sick  or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting,...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Show more Show less ","Sep 18, 2020","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html","cdc.gov","","United States","84","73.86","71.87","fairness.datasciencevn.com/uploads/html/10-1-1601904432.html"

Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.

If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don't know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.

Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:  Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it’s COVID-19? Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.

If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet's treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time.   What is a novel coronavirus? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans  and cause mild illness, like the common cold.  Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it's always a good idea to practice healthy habits  around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.   What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)? Imported animals will need to meet CDC  and USDA'sexternal icon  requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.

This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.   Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak? Please refer to CDC's requirements for bringing a dog to the United States . The current requirements for rabies vaccination  apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.  Are imported animals or animal products safe? CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates  animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulates  animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulates  importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources.

   What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19.

Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19.  Do not let pets in the facility interact with sick people. Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility. Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible. Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. People sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals. Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas. Cats should be kept...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Can I take my dog to daycare or a groomer? Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather.

Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a mask  and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible.

Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectant  to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol,...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Can I take my dog to a dog park? Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather.

Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park.  Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are sick  or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting,...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Show more Show less ","Sep 18, 2020","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html","cdc.gov","","United States","84","73.86","71.76","fairness.datasciencevn.com/uploads/html/22-1-1601905291.html"

Can anyone be tested for the coronavirus? Not everyone will be tested for coronavirus. People who think they need to be tested due to a confirmed exposure should contact their primary care doctor. If appropriate, your doctor will advise you on where to go for testing.  Is there a fee for COVID-19 screening or testing? The California Department of Managed Health Care directed all commercial health plans and Medi-Cal health plans to cover the cost for medically necessary screening and testing for COVID-19. This includes waiving the member's share of costs for the emergency room, urgent care or visits with a doctor. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has directed that Medicare Part B will cover all medically necessary COVID-19 testing only. Patients with Medicare Part B plans are still responsible for emergency, urgent care or doctor's office visit fees, even if related to COVID-19.  How do I request documentation of my COVID-19 test results? The easiest way to access documentation of your COVID-19 test results is through FollowMyHealth. You can also request your hospital or Sharp Rees-Stealy COVID-19 test results.  Is Sharp testing patients for the coronavirus? If the patient meets the criteria for a COVID-19 test, a caregiver will take a nasal swab and send it to a Sharp laboratory. In some cases, the patient will be instructed to self-test under the guidance of a caregiver. This is currently the protocol that is in place for all Sharp HealthCare facilities.  Does Sharp offer antibody testing for COVID-19? Sharp is providing COVID-19 antibody testing to a small number of patients who meet specific criteria. This includes young patients being ruled out for multisystem inflammatory syndrome-children (MIS-C), a rare, life-threatening condition that follows COVID-19 infection.  Where do I get the test if I don't have insurance? If you have a primary care doctor, we suggest that you contact your doctor to be evaluated. Not every patient will be tested for coronavirus, so we recommend that you receive an evaluation by a doctor before coming to the hospital or an urgent care center.  What should I do if I think I have the coronavirus? If you have had close contact with someone who is confirmed to have, or is being evaluated for, coronavirus, and think you may be sick, the CDC recommends self-isolation within your home.  What should I do if I am being evaluated for the coronavirus? If you're being evaluated for the virus and don't need to be hospitalized, you should take the following steps:  Does Sharp offer ""drive-thru"" testing or ""testing tents""? Sharp does not currently provide ""drive-thru"" testing or ""testing tents"". If you think you need to be tested, please call your primary care doctor, who will advise you on where to go for testing.  How is Sharp screening patients for the coronavirus? Sharp HealthCare facilities have a standard protocol in place for any infectious disease, including the coronavirus, and each facility has a surge capacity plan to ensure proper care is delivered to all our patients.

Here's what to do if you think you have coronavirus symptoms and what to expect.   How do I get tested for COVID-19? If you are a Scripps patient and have COVID-19 symptoms, such as a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, please start by calling our nurse line at 888-261-8431 . Or you can use one of our virtual care  options. Scripps is only testing people with moderate symptoms of COVID-19, especially those who are at higher risk. This includes health care workers; older adults; and patients with compromised immune systems or chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney or liver disease. If it is medically necessary for you to be tested, Scripps will test you.

The County of San Diego and the State of California have multiple testing sites throughout San Diego. Testing is prioritized for people with symptoms and for asymptomatic individuals who are at high risk, including healthcare workers, first responders and essential workers, residents and employees in group living facilities and people who may have been exposed in high-risk situations....&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Who should be tested for coronavirus? Due to limited availability of test supplies, Scripps is not testing individuals with little to no symptoms.

For those who are not tested or are awaiting the results of their COVID-19 test, the CDC offers guidance on what to do if you are sick .   When should I seek medical attention for coronavirus symptoms? If you develop any of the following symptoms of COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*:


 Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion  Inability to get up Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.

Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the operator that you have or think you might have COVID-19. If possible, put on a cloth face covering that covers your nose and mouth to protect other people.   What should I do if I believe I may have been infected with coronavirus? If you have fever and/or respiratory symptoms, it is important that you call our dedicated COVID-19 nurse line at 888-261-8431  before coming in or take advantage of one of our virtual care options .

Can wild animals spread the virus that causes COVID-19 to people or pets? Currently, there is no evidence to suggest the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating in free-living wildlife in the United States, or that wildlife might be a source of infection for people in the United States.

If a wild animal were to become infected with the virus, we don't know whether the infection could then spread among wildlife or if it could spread to other animals, including pets. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including wildlife, could be affected by COVID-19. Because wildlife can carry other diseases, even without looking sick, it is always important to enjoy wildlife from a distance.

Take steps to prevent getting sick from wildlife in the United States:  Keep your family, including pets, a safe distance away from wildlife. Do not feed wildlife or touch wildlife droppings. Always wash your hands and supervise children washing their hands after working or playing outside. Leave orphaned animals alone. Often, the parents are close...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   What should I do if my pet gets sick and I think it’s COVID-19? Most pets that have gotten sick from the virus that causes COVID-19 were infected after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Talk to your veterinarian about any health concerns you have about your pets.

If your pet gets sick after contact with a person with COVID-19, call your veterinarian and let them know the pet was around a person with COVID-19. If you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets. Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and determine the next steps for your pet's treatment and care. Routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended at this time.   What is a novel coronavirus? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans  and cause mild illness, like the common cold.  Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur? Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it's always a good idea to practice healthy habits  around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them.   What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)? Imported animals will need to meet CDC  and USDA'sexternal icon  requirements for entering the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread the virus that causes COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.

This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.   Can I travel to the United States with dogs or import dogs into the United States during the COVID-19 outbreak? Please refer to CDC's requirements for bringing a dog to the United States . The current requirements for rabies vaccination  apply to dogs imported from high-risk countries for rabies.  Are imported animals or animal products safe? CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. CDC, the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the United States. CDC regulates  animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health, USDA regulates  animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; and FWS regulates  importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources.

   What should I do if there are pets at my long-term care facility or assisted living facility? Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. However, it appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact with people with COVID-19.

Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, use similar precautions for pets and other animals in your facility as you would for other people in your facility. This will help protect both people and pets in your facility from COVID-19.  Do not let pets in the facility interact with sick people. Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility. Residents should avoid letting their pets interact with people as much as possible. Dogs should be walked on a leash at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others. People sick with COVID-19 should avoid contact with pets and other animals. Do not allow pets into common areas of the facility such as cafeterias and social areas. Cats should be kept...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Can I take my dog to daycare or a groomer? Until we know more about how this virus affects animals, CDC encourages pet owners to treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from possible infection. This means limiting contact between your pets and people outside your household as much as possible and avoiding places where large numbers of people gather.

Some areas are allowing groomers and boarding facilities such as dog daycares to open. If you must take your pet to a groomer or boarding facility, follow any protocols put into place at the facility, such as wearing a mask  and maintaining at least 6 feet of space between yourself and others if possible.

Limit pet items brought from home to the groomer or boarding facility, and disinfect any objects that are taken into a facility and returned home (such as leashes, bowls, and toys). Use an EPA-registered disinfectant  to clean items and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol,...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Can I take my dog to a dog park? Dog parks provide socialization and exercise for dogs, which is an important part of their wellbeing. Because there is a risk that people with COVID-19 could spread it to animals, CDC recommends that you do not let pets interact with people outside of your household, especially in places with community spread of COVID-19. Therefore, you should consider avoiding dog parks or other places where large numbers of people and dogs gather.

Some areas are allowing dog parks to open. If you choose to go to a dog park, follow local guidelines. There are ways to reduce the risk of you or your dog getting infected with COVID-19 if you go to a dog park.  Do not take your dog to a dog park if you are sick  or if you have recently been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Do not take your dog to a dog park if your dog is sick. Signs of sickness in dogs may include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, vomiting,...&nbsp;&nbsp;More   Show more Show less ","Sep 18, 2020","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html","cdc.gov","","United States","84","73.86","72.35","fairness.datasciencevn.com/uploads/html/62-1-1601908839.html"
